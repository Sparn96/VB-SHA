# VB-SHA
My attempt at creating and understanding the creation of secure passwords for a database


Visual Basic.NET and using System.Cryptography libraries in order to store passwords in an excel sheet


The ultimate goal is to have my website www.auxidus.net (and .com) allow users to create an account and then store the user 
password as a salted hash in an excel sheet (to act as a database until I understand SQL better)
